### Functionality

#### Editing

- [ ] Control should only format it's contents on 'change'/'focusout'/'blur' - This will allow the user to edit the
  control's contents without having the cursor move out from under them.

- [ ] When the flag that signals controls to display their validation inline, is set to `true` (TBD), and control's
  validity state is invalid, control should display it's errors `inline` (underneath it's 'help' slot).
